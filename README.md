# Problem Statement

In the competitive retail industry, the ability to predict future sales accurately is crucial for operational and strategic planning. Product sales forecasting aims to estimate the number of products a store will sell in the future, based on various influencing factors such as store type, location, regional characteristics, promotional activities, and temporal variations (such as holidays and seasons). This project focuses on developing a predictive model that uses historical sales data from different stores to forecast sales for upcoming periods.

# Data description

1.	ID: Unique identifier for each record in the dataset.
2.	Store_id: Unique identifier for each store.
3.	Store_Type: Categorization of the store based on its type.
4.	Location_Type: Classification of the store's location (e.g., urban, suburban).
5.	Region_Code: Code representing the geographical region where the store is located.
6.	Date: The specific date on which the data was recorded.
7.	Holiday: Indicator of whether the date was a holiday (1: Yes, 0: No).
8.	Discount: Indicates whether a discount was offered on the given date (Yes/No).
9.	#Order: The number of orders received by the store on the specified day.
10.	Sales: Total sales amount for the store on the given day.

# Model Evaluation: Selection of R-squared (R²) Score

In this project, we will use the R-squared (R²) score as our primary evaluation metric. The R² score, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (sales) that is predictable from the independent variables (features).
Why R² Score?
Interpretability: The R² score ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variance, and 1 indicates that the model explains all the variance. This makes it easy to understand how well the model is performing.
Suitability for Regression: Since we are dealing with a regression problem, where the goal is to predict a continuous variable (sales), the R² score is a natural choice. It provides a clear indication of how well the model is capturing the relationship between the features and the target variable.
Comparative Analysis: The R² score allows us to compare the performance of different models on the same scale. A higher R² score indicates a better fit, making it useful for evaluating and selecting the best model.

By focusing on the R² score, we can effectively measure and compare the performance of our models, ensuring that we select the one that best explains the variance in sales.
